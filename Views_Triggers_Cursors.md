### **1. Views**

- **Definition**: A *View* is a virtual table created from a SQL query that presents data from one or more underlying tables without storing it independently. It represents a subset or transformation of data in a database.
  
- **Key Points**:
  - **Read-Only vs. Updatable Views**:
    - **Read-Only Views**: Allow users to view data but not modify it.
    - **Updatable Views**: Permit data modification, though only under specific conditions (e.g., they must reference a single table without aggregations or group functions).
  - **Creation**: Created using `CREATE VIEW` statement.
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW view_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    ```

- **Benefits**:
  - **Security**: Restricts access to specific columns or rows.
  - **Simplicity**: Simplifies complex queries by abstracting them.
  - **Data Abstraction**: Allows hiding of underlying table structure.
  
- **Advanced Concepts**:
  - **Materialized Views**: Unlike standard views, materialized views store the result of the query physically, allowing faster access but requiring maintenance to stay up-to-date.
  - **Indexed Views**: In some databases, indexes can be created on views to enhance performance, particularly useful for frequently queried complex views.
  - **Recursive Views**: Used to handle recursive queries, often employed in hierarchical data (e.g., employee-manager relationships).

### **2. Triggers**

- **Definition**: A *Trigger* is a stored procedure that automatically executes in response to specified events on a table (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).

- **Types of Triggers**:
  - **Before Triggers**: Execute before an operation, allowing for data validation or manipulation before changes are committed.
  - **After Triggers**: Execute after an operation, often used to enforce constraints or maintain audit logs.

- **Key Points**:
  - **Syntax Example**:
    ```sql
    CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
    AFTER INSERT ON table_name
    FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
       -- SQL statements
    END;
    ```
  - **Uses**:
    - **Data Integrity**: Enforce business rules (e.g., maintaining a history of changes).
    - **Automatic Auditing**: Track who changed data and when.
    - **Complex Computations**: Automatically derive or update data in related tables.

- **Advanced Concepts**:
  - **Compound Triggers**: Particularly in Oracle, they allow defining a set of actions across different timing points in a single trigger (BEFORE/AFTER).
  - **Mutating Triggers**: If a trigger tries to query or update the same table itâ€™s modifying, it may lead to a mutating table error, especially in row-level triggers.
  - **Nested Triggers**: Some databases support calling other triggers within a trigger, which can lead to a series of cascading effects. This may be beneficial but can also cause unintended recursion or performance issues.

### **3. Cursors**

- **Definition**: A *Cursor* allows row-by-row processing of query results, which is essential in cases where set-based processing is insufficient, such as complex updates or operations dependent on the results of other rows.

- **Types of Cursors**:
  - **Implicit Cursors**: Automatically created by the database when a SQL statement is executed, primarily for single-statement queries.
  - **Explicit Cursors**: Defined and controlled by the programmer to handle multi-row query results manually.

- **Key Points**:
  - **Basic Cursor Usage**:
    ```sql
    DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name;
    
    OPEN cursor_name;
    FETCH NEXT FROM cursor_name INTO variable1, variable2;
    CLOSE cursor_name;
    ```
  - **Cursor Operations**:
    - **OPEN**: Initializes and populates the cursor.
    - **FETCH**: Retrieves the next row in the result set.
    - **CLOSE**: Releases the cursor's resources.

- **Advanced Concepts**:
  - **Cursor Attributes**: Such as `%ROWCOUNT`, `%FOUND`, `%NOTFOUND` help in determining the status and behavior of a cursor.
  - **Scrollable Cursors**: Allow moving forward and backward through rows, unlike standard cursors which only go forward.
  - **Parameterized Cursors**: Accept parameters when declared, making them versatile for various inputs.
  - **Cursor Performance Implications**: Cursors can be resource-intensive, especially if overused. Cursors should be avoided in favor of set-based operations wherever possible.

### **Comparison and Use Cases**

- **Views** are optimal for simplifying access to complex queries and enforcing security by limiting data exposure.
- **Triggers** are best for enforcing business rules, auditing, and automatic actions, especially when data integrity is critical.
- **Cursors** are useful when operations require a detailed row-by-row processing approach that cannot be achieved with simple SQL operations.

### **Exam-Edge Concepts and Unique Points**

1. **Indexed Views and Materialized Views**: Not all views are indexed or materialized, and understanding the distinction (e.g., performance implications) can add value in advanced queries.
2. **Recursive Triggers and Mutating Table Problem**: Understanding trigger interactions and potential recursion/mutating issues is critical for complex database management.
3. **Scrollable and Parameterized Cursors**: These advanced cursor types are valuable in database systems that require flexible data processing patterns beyond typical use.
