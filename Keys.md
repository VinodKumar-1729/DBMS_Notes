### Keys in Databases
Keys in databases are fundamental elements that ensure data integrity and enable efficient data retrieval. They uniquely identify records, establish relationships between tables, and help maintain the structure and consistency of data within a database.

---

#### 1. **Primary Key**
   - **Definition**: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table, ensuring that no two rows can have the same primary key value.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Must contain unique values across all records.
     - Cannot have NULL values (ensures complete identification of records).
     - There can only be one primary key per table.
   - **Usage Example**:
     - `CustomerID` in a `Customer` table can serve as a primary key, uniquely identifying each customer.
   - **Exam Tip**: Primary keys are often used to create indexes, which speed up query operations.
   - **Unique Detail**: When combined with other keys, a primary key can participate in a composite key if it spans multiple attributes (columns).

#### 2. **Foreign Key**
   - **Definition**: A foreign key is an attribute (or set of attributes) in a table that references the primary key in another table, thereby creating a relationship between the two tables.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Enables referential integrity, ensuring that the foreign key value in the referencing table matches an existing primary key in the referenced table.
     - Can have NULL values if the relationship is optional.
     - Foreign keys can also be composite keys.
   - **Usage Example**:
     - `CustomerID` in an `Order` table is a foreign key that links orders to specific customers in the `Customer` table.
   - **Exam Tip**: In competitive exams, questions on cascading actions (like `ON DELETE CASCADE`) are common, where deleting a record in one table can automatically delete related records in another.
   - **Unique Detail**: Foreign keys can enforce complex relationships, such as one-to-many or many-to-many relationships, through associative tables.

#### 3. **Candidate Key**
   - **Definition**: A candidate key is any attribute or a combination of attributes that can uniquely identify a record within a table.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Multiple candidate keys may exist in a table, but only one is chosen as the primary key.
     - Candidate keys are minimal, meaning no subset of attributes within the candidate key can uniquely identify records.
   - **Usage Example**:
     - In an `Employee` table, both `EmployeeID` and `NationalID` could serve as candidate keys if each can uniquely identify an employee.
   - **Exam Tip**: Recognizing candidate keys involves understanding the uniqueness of attributes and the minimal superkey concept.
   - **Unique Detail**: Candidate keys that are not chosen as primary keys are termed as alternate keys. Candidate keys are also known as "minimal superkeys."

#### 4. **Alternate Key**
   - **Definition**: An alternate key is a candidate key that was not selected as the primary key.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Holds unique values like the primary key but is not used as the primary identifier.
     - Can still serve as a unique constraint, ensuring that no duplicate values exist in that column.
   - **Usage Example**:
     - In a `Student` table, if `RollNumber` is chosen as the primary key, `StudentID` could be an alternate key.
   - **Exam Tip**: Sometimes, exams may test your understanding by presenting both candidate and alternate keys in scenarios requiring identification of the primary key.
   - **Unique Detail**: Alternate keys are often used in searches or queries where primary key values are unknown or less practical.

### Additional Types of Keys for Enhanced Understanding

#### 5. **Composite Key**
   - **Definition**: A composite key consists of two or more attributes that together uniquely identify a record.
   - **Usage**:
     - Frequently used when no single attribute can uniquely identify records on its own.
     - Often found in junction tables (for example, in many-to-many relationships).
   - **Example**:
     - In a `CourseRegistration` table, a composite key could include `StudentID` and `CourseID` to uniquely identify each registration entry.
   - **Unique Detail**: All attributes in a composite key must be necessary for uniqueness; otherwise, it would no longer be minimal.

#### 6. **Super Key**
   - **Definition**: A super key is any combination of attributes that can uniquely identify a record in a table, but it is not required to be minimal.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Includes all candidate keys, as well as any superset of candidate keys.
   - **Usage**:
     - Sometimes used for defining larger sets of attributes for identification or in scenarios where multiple fields collectively provide uniqueness.
   - **Exam Tip**: Differentiate between super keys and candidate keys; super keys do not need to be minimal, whereas candidate keys are minimal.
   - **Unique Detail**: All primary keys and candidate keys are also super keys, but not all super keys are candidate keys.

#### 7. **Surrogate Key**
   - **Definition**: A surrogate key is an artificially created key, typically a sequential number, used as the primary key.
   - **Characteristics**:
     - Has no intrinsic business meaning, usually auto-generated by the database system.
     - Useful when no natural key exists, or using a natural key may be impractical.
   - **Example**:
     - An auto-incremented `OrderID` in an `Orders` table, which serves as a unique identifier but has no other significance.
   - **Exam Tip**: Surrogate keys are preferred in cases where composite keys would be unwieldy.

### Additional Points for Competitive Edge
   - **NULL Values**: Only foreign keys are allowed to have NULL values under certain circumstances. Primary and candidate keys cannot contain NULLs.
   - **Indexing**: Primary keys are automatically indexed by most DBMS, which can speed up data retrieval.
   - **Composite vs. Surrogate Keys**: Composite keys are often required in normalized databases to avoid redundant data, while surrogate keys provide simplicity in unique identification.
   - **Constraints**: Primary and alternate keys often have constraints that enforce uniqueness (`UNIQUE` constraint) and integrity (`NOT NULL` constraint).
   - **Cascading Actions**: `ON DELETE` and `ON UPDATE` options are often associated with foreign keys, ensuring data consistency across related tables.
