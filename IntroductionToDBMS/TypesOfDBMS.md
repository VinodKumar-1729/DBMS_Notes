## **1. Hierarchical DBMS**  
**Definition**:  
- A **Hierarchical DBMS** organizes data in a **tree-like structure** where each record has a single parent but can have multiple child records.  
- The relationships between data elements are represented as a **parent-child relationship**.

**Key Points**:  
- Data is stored in a **hierarchy of levels**.  
- Navigation is done from **top to bottom** through links.  
- Efficient for applications with **one-to-many relationships**.  
- Example: **IMS (Information Management System)** by IBM.  

**Structure Example**:  
```
Organization  
│  
├── Department 1  
│    ├── Employee 1  
│    ├── Employee 2  
│  
└── Department 2  
     ├── Employee 3  
     ├── Employee 4  
```

**Advantages**:  
1. **Fast data access** due to a clear hierarchy.  
2. Works well for applications with predictable relationships.  
3. Enforces **data integrity** through a clear parent-child link.  

**Disadvantages**:  
1. **Rigid structure**; difficult to modify or add relationships.  
2. Complex navigation for many-to-many relationships.  
3. Data redundancy if similar data exists in multiple hierarchies.

## **2. Network DBMS**  
**Definition**:  
- A **Network DBMS** organizes data using a **graph structure**, where a record can have multiple parents and children.  
- Relationships are represented as **pointers** or **links**.

**Key Points**:  
- Allows **many-to-many relationships**.  
- Data is represented as **nodes** (records) connected via **edges** (links).  
- Example: **CODASYL DBMS**, Integrated Data Store (IDS).  

**Structure Example**:  
```
Course  
│       \  
│        └── Student  
└── Teacher  
          └── Student  
```
Here, a **Student** can have multiple Teachers and Courses.

**Advantages**:  
1. Supports **many-to-many relationships**.  
2. Flexible structure for complex applications.  
3. Improved performance with efficient navigation.  

**Disadvantages**:  
1. Complex structure due to pointers and links.  
2. Difficult to modify or update relationships.  
3. Requires **programmers** to manage navigation paths.

## **3. Relational DBMS (RDBMS)**  
**Definition**:  
- A **Relational DBMS** organizes data into **tables** (relations) where each table consists of **rows** (records) and **columns** (attributes).  
- Relationships between tables are established using **keys** (Primary Key, Foreign Key).

**Key Points**:  
- Uses **Structured Query Language (SQL)** for data management.  
- Most widely used DBMS model today.  
- Supports **data integrity**, **normalization**, and **ACID properties**.  
- Examples: **MySQL**, **Oracle**, **SQL Server**, **PostgreSQL**.  

**Structure Example**:  
```text
Table 1: Student  
| Student_ID | Name  | Age |  
|------------|-------|-----|  
| 101        | John  | 20  |  
| 102        | Alice | 21  |  

Table 2: Course  
| Course_ID  | Course_Name | Student_ID |  
|------------|-------------|------------|  
| C1         | DBMS        | 101        |  
| C2         | OS          | 102        |  

Relation: Student_ID is a **Foreign Key** in Table 2.
```

**Advantages**:  
1. Easy to use and understand due to table format.  
2. Reduces data redundancy using **normalization**.  
3. Supports complex queries through **SQL**.  
4. Ensures **data integrity** and **consistency**.  

**Disadvantages**:  
1. High computational requirements for large databases.  
2. Performance issues when handling very complex relationships.  
3. Requires skilled personnel to design and maintain.

## **4. Object-Oriented DBMS (OODBMS)**  
**Definition**:  
- An **Object-Oriented DBMS** combines database concepts with **object-oriented programming** principles.  
- Data is stored in the form of **objects**, similar to objects in programming languages like Java or C++.

**Key Points**:  
- Supports **classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism**.  
- Useful for applications requiring complex data types like images, videos, etc.  
- Example: **ObjectStore**, **db4o**, **Versant**.  

**Structure Example**:  
```text
Class: Student  
Attributes: Student_ID, Name, Age  
Methods: GetDetails(), UpdateDetails()  

Object 1: { Student_ID: 101, Name: "John", Age: 20 }  
Object 2: { Student_ID: 102, Name: "Alice", Age: 21 }  
```

**Advantages**:  
1. Supports complex data types (images, audio, video).  
2. Integrates with **object-oriented programming** seamlessly.  
3. Efficient for applications with **real-world objects**.  

**Disadvantages**:  
1. Complexity in designing and implementing OODBMS.  
2. Not as widely adopted as RDBMS.  
3. High learning curve for developers.
